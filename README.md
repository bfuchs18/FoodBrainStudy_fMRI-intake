## Folder Structure

### code/

This folder contains .R and .Rmd files used for analyses and plots

In this folder:

-   setup_data.R : imports and organizes raw data (sourced by determine_analysis_sample.R)
-   determine_analysis_sample.R : generates dataframe to determine which subjects meet criteria for analyses (sourced by feis_portionsize.R)
-   feis_portionsize.R : extracts individual-level portion size slopes using FEIS models (sourced by gen_fmri_covtable.R)
-   gen_fmri_covtable.R : generates a table with predictors and covariates for fmri analyses. exports table as csv into /BIDS/derivatives/analyses/foodcue-paper2/R/ (sourced by gen_fmri_index.R)
-   gen_fmri_index.R : generates "index files" that list subjects to include in fmri analyses. exports data as .txt files into /BIDS/derivatives/analyses/foodcue-paper2/R/ (sourced by analyze_descriptives.Rmd, analyze_beh.Rmd)
-   analyze_descriptives.Rmd: generates descriptive statistics for fmri predictors/covariates and demographics
-   analyze_beh.Rmd: plots and analyzes in-scanner behavioral data (percent wanting)
-   cerebellum-intake_plot.Rmd: plots the association between cerebellar BOLD responses to portion size and quadratic portion size slopes

### data/

#### data/raw

This folder contains data raw data used as input for code in R/

-   FILE: {description}

### BIDS/code

This folder contains code to (1) process in-scanner wanting data and (2) process and analyze fMRI data

#### BIDS/code/foodcue_proc

This folder contains code used to generate derivatives needed for fmri analyses in AFNI (e.g., onset files, censor files).
Scripts that begin with p_ contain functions that can be run for 1 subject at a time.

- p0_getbehavial.py: summarizes behavioral (wanting) data from the food-cue task by block
- p1_getonsets.py: generates onset files that contain onsets for all runs (even those with high motion) 
- p2_create_censor_files.py: will process -desc-confounds_timeseries.tsv files (output from fmriprep). Outputs regressor and censor files.
- p4a_gen_byrun_onsets.py: generates onset files that exclude runs with motion above a certain threshold
- p6_calc_avg_motion.py: calculates the average framewise displacement during food-cue task for a subject. exports data into {}
- wrapper-python_paper2.py: runs p0, p1, p2, p4a, p6 for all subjects with food-cue task data in bids/raw_data

#### BIDS/code/afni/

This folder contains code used to process and analyze MRI data following fmriprep

-   gen_sub_scripts_paper2: generates a wrapper file for each subject using templates in template_scripts/. The wrapper will be used to call scripts in proc_scripts/
-   proc_scripts/1_smooth-scale: smooths (blurs) and scales fmri data (uses derivatives from fmriprep)
-   proc_scripts/2_createmask: creates overall foodcue mask using separate foodcue run masks (uses derivatives from fmriprep)
-   proc_scripts/3_3ddeconvolve: runs first-level GLM (uses derivatives from fmriprep and output from code in BIDS/code/foodcue_proc/)
-   template_scripts/paper2_wrapper-afni: template wrapper
-   template_scripts/paper2_wrapper-afni.pbs: template to run paper2_wrapper-afni on Penn State computing cluster via PBS job scheduler

#### BIDS/code/afni/groupanalyses_paper2

This folder contains code to run group-level analyses.

-   3dcalc_clust_mask: {description}
-   G0_copylevel1: copies level-1 GLM files in paper-specific analysis folder
-   G1_feis: runs regressions (via 3dttest++) predicting BOLD responses to food amount from portion size slopes and covariates
-   G1_feis.PBS and G1_feis.slurm: these run G1_feis on Penn State computing clusters via PBS and SLURM job schedulers 
-   G2_extract: extract beta values for the cerebellum cluster with activation to Large-Small portions associated with quadratic portion size slopes 
-   G3_extract.PBS: runs G2_extract on Penn State computing cluster via PBS job scheduler

### BIDS/derivatives/

This folder contains derivative files used as input for code in code/

-   preprocessed/beh/task-foodcue_summary.tsv: contains behavioral (wanting) data from the food-cue task by block. Generated by BIDS/code/foodcue_proc/p0_getbehavial.py
-   preprocessed/beh/task-foodcue_summary.json: contains meta data for preprocessed/beh/task-foodcue_summary.tsv
-   preprocessed/fmriprep/foodcue-avg_fd.tsv: contains average framewise displacement for each subject. Generated by BIDS/code/foodcue_proc/p6_calc_avg_motion.py
-   analyses/foodcue-paper2/R/: folder with index files and covariate files generated by code in BIDS/code/ and used by code in BIDS/code/afni/groupanalyses_paper2
-   analyses/foodcue-paper2/level2/feis_cerebellum/ped_fd-0.9_b20_3runs_noGSR_09-05-23/fmri_covariates.csv: Covariate file used via G1_feis for analyses 
-   analyses/foodcue-paper2/level2/feis_cerebellum/ped_fd-0.9_b20_3runs_noGSR_09-05-23/cerebellum_betas.txt: Larger-Smaller contrast values extract from cerebellum. Generated by BIDS/code/afni/groupanalyses_paper2/G2_extract
